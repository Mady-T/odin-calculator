A first attempt at the classic calculator program: this time, in Javascript!

The calculator only calculates two operands at a time, so no need to bother with precedence rules for me!
However, you can still chain together operations before pressing "=" in a left-to-right evaluation method disregarding precedence!

Currently, it only supports the classic addition, multiplacation, subtraction, division and the modulus operators.
